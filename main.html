Baby come on
If the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave
Or will you rail against your dying day
And when we looked outside, couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent, is it your parents
Or is it hard work dear, holding the atmosphere?
I don't wanna live like that
If the sun don't shine on me today
If the subways flood and the bridges break
Jesus Christ can't save me tonight
Put on your dress, yes wear something nice
Decide on me, yeah decide on us
Oh, oh, oh, Illinois, Illinois
Pack yourself a toothbrush, dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip
Take all of your savings out
'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out
